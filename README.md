# Monokai Materia Kai

Themes and color schemes inspired by Monokai, Materia GTK, Material Design, and the \*NIX customization community.

Because computing can be fun and simple and colorful and make people happy :) .

## Supported Apps + Previews
- IntelliJ (UI theme and editor color scheme)
- Sublime Text 4 (UI theme (WIP) and editor color scheme)
- Windows Terminal (color scheme)

## Color Palette
The Monokai Materia Kai color palette was originally born as a color scheme for text editors and terminal emulators. Later, the color palette was expanded to include more shades of each primary color for use in UI themes, where additional shades can help create a better end result.

Note that several colors are named semantically by intended use (background, selection, comment, etc.).

## Contributing
Pull requests for unsupported apps are welcome. I spend almost all day in the apps above and do not plan to expand support to other apps at this time.
